# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# atom + filename

You can use the `atom` command when you have a file that you want to open in the interface Atom. Let's say you have a file to open named README.md. In your terminal type `atom README.md` and it will open that file in Atom.

### Uses for the atom command
* nothing
* nothing
